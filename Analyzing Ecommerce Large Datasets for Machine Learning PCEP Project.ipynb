    "# Transformational AI: Analyzing Ecommerce Large Datasets for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your journey as a data scientist at Transformational AI, where you will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our company's machine learning models. In this project, you will leverage two Amazon Reviews 2023 datasets, originally sourced from Hugging Face, to perform data transformation, analysis, and visualization. Through this notebook, you will gain hands-on experience with pandas DataFrames and explore powerful data visualization techniques using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`. You will also learn to export your cleaned and processed data into `.csv` and `.parquet` formats, ready for advanced machine learning tasks. Get ready to dive into the world of data science and make impactful contributions to our machine learning team by preparing top-quality datasets for model fine-tuning and customer satisfaction analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not worry if this sounds like a lot right now. Transformational AI makes no mistakes and we hired you for a reason. We will take this one step at a time, and know you have our full support every step of the way. We will be using a lot of advanced language and words, which will add to your Pythonic knowledge and background, while, reinforcing core concepts that you will need to know for your upcoming PCEP exam.\n",

    "- `datasets`: Providres access to a wide range of datasets, including the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset we'll be using.\n",

    "- `matplotlib`: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "- `seaborn`: Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, great for visualizing trends from data.\n",
    "- `pyarrow`: A fast and efficient library for reading and writing data in the Apache Arrow format, like Parquet and Feather, to handle large amounts of data efficiently.\n",

    "To accomplish this, we'll:\n",
    "- Filter the DataFrame: We'll filter the DataFrame to include only products with an average rating of `4.7` or higher.\n",
    "- Sort the DataFrame: We'll use the `.sort_values` method to sort the DataFrame by average rating in descending order.\n",
    "- Display the DataFrame: We'll display the sorted DataFrame as a table.\n",
    "- Create a Scatterplot: We'll create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between price and average rating for the highly rated products.\n",

    "#### STEPS TO COMPLETE:\n",
    "- [ ] Set the `highly_rated_products_df_cutoff` with the desired float threshold value\n",
    "- [ ] Update the `highly_rated_products_df` to use the `.sort_values` method like you learned in class.\n",
